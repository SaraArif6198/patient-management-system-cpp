# 🏥 Patient Management System (C++)

A simple console-based **Patient Management System** built using **C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It allows hospital staff to manage patient records, assign doctors, and perform operations such as admit, discharge, update, and display patient details.

> 📌 This project was developed as part of an **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** course assignment.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ **Admit Patients** with ID, personal info, disease, and assigned doctor  
- 🗃️ **Update Patient Info** (Name, Address, Blood Group, Disease, Doctor)  
- ❌ **Discharge Patient** by removing their record  
- 📋 **Display** individual or all patient records  
- 🔍 **Count** total admitted patients  
- 💾 File handling via `patient.txt` for persistent data storage  
- 📚 Follows OOP structure with `Person`, `Doctor`, and `Hospital` classes  

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **Concepts:** OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance), File Handling, Exception Handling  
- **Platform:** Windows (uses `windows.h` for `Sleep()` and `system("cls")`)

## 🎓 Educational Context

This project was developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** curriculum to demonstrate real-world class modeling, data abstraction, and modular file-based storage using C++.
